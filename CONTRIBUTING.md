The content of this wiki will be included in a forthcoming book and hence I need to own the copyright for the complete content of the wiki. I will make some money from the book, but it's not likely to be a huge amount. This site will continue to be freely available and I'll acknowledge all contributions in the printed book.

To confirm that you're ok with giving me your copyright, please include the 
phrase: "I assign the copyright of this contribution to Hadley Wickham".

If you have any questions, feel free to raise them in the pull request, or 
send me [an email](mailto:h.wickham@gmail.com).
