(<https://style.tidyverse.org>)，它比我们在这里介绍的更详细。\n它的格式也使其成为比本书更具活力的文档。\n\n尽管风格指南解释了“什么”和“为什么”，另一个重要的决定是如何实施特定的代码风格。\n为此，我们推荐 styler 包 (<https://styler.r-lib.org>)；它的默认行为强制执行 tidyverse 风格指南。\n有多种方法可以将 styler 应用于您的代码，具体取决于上下文：\n\n-   `styler::style_pkg()` 重新设置整个 R 包的样式。\n-   `styler::style_dir()` 重新设置目录中所有文件的样式。\n-   `usethis::use_tidy_style()` 是根据当前项目是否为 R 包应用上述功能之一的包装器。\n-   `styler::style_file()` 重新设置单个文件的样式。\n-   `styler::style_file()` 重新设置字符向量的样式。\n\n::: callout-tip\n## RStudio\n\n安装 styler 后，RStudio Addins 菜单将提供几种额外的样式代码方式：\n\n-   the active selection\n-   the active file\n-   the active

GitHub 操作，当拉取请求中的特殊评论 (`/style`) 触发时，该操作会重新设置包的样式。\n这允许维护者专注于审查拉取请求的实质内容，而不必挑剔空白或缩进的小问题[^code-2][^code-3]。\n\n[^code-2]: 请参阅 [GitHub Actions for the R language](https://github.com/r-lib/actions)

代码保存在您交互式执行的文件中，可能使用 IDE 和/或 `source()`，或者通过 `Rscript` 非交互式执行。\n脚本和包中的代码之间有两个主要区别：\n\n-   在脚本中，代码运行 ... 当你运行它的时候！\n    这种说法的尴尬反映了用剧本来思考这个问题是很困难的。\n    但是，我们必须了解包中的代码是在构建包时运行的。\n    这对你如何编写 `R/` 下的代码有很大的影响：包代码应该只创建对象，其中绝大多数是函数。\n\n-   你的包中的函数将在你没有想象到的情况下使用。\n    这意味着您的函数在与外界交互的方式上需要深思熟虑。\n\n我们在这里扩展第一点，在下一节中扩展第二点。\n这些主题也在 @sec-package-within-build-time-run-time 中具体说明。\n\n当你 `source()` 一个脚本时，每一行代码都会被执行，结果会立即可用。\n包代码的情况不同，因为它是分两步加载的。\n当构建二进制包时（通常由 CRAN），`R/` 中的所有代码都会被执行并保存结果。\n当您使用 `library()` 附加一个包时，这些缓存的结果将被重新加载，并且某些对象（主要是函数）可供您使用。\n@sec-structure-binary 中给出了二进制形式的包的含义的完整详细信息。\n我们将二进制包的创建称为（binary）“构建时间”，具体来说，我们指的是 `R CMD INSTALL --build` 运行时。\n（您可能认为这就是 `R CMD build` 所做的，但实际上它生成了一个捆绑包，也就是\"source tarball\"。）对于 CRAN 包的 macOS 和 Windows 用户，构建时间是 CRAN 为其操作系统构建二进制包时。\n对于那些从源代码安装包的人来说，构建时间本质上是他们（构建和）安装包的时间。\n\n考虑赋值 `x <- Sys.time()`。\n如果你把它放在脚本中，`x` 会告诉你脚本何时是 `source()`d。\n但是，如果您将相同的代码放在包的顶层，`x` 会告诉您包二进制文件的构建时间。\n在 @sec-package-within-build-time-run-time 中，我们展示了在包内形成时间戳的上下文中的完整示例。\n\n主要内容是：\n\n> 函数之外的任何 R 代码都是可疑的，应该仔细检查。\n\n我们在下面探索了一些真实世界的例子，这些例子展示了这个“构建时间与加载时间”问题是多么容易被烧毁。\n幸运的是，一旦您诊断出此问题，通常不难解决。\n\n### Example: A path returned by `system.file()`\n\nThe shinybootstrap2 package once had this code below `R/`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndataTableDependency <- list(\n  htmlDependency(\n    \"datatables\", \"1.10.2\",\n    c(file = system.file(\"www/datatables\", package = \"shinybootstrap2\")),\n    script = \"js/jquery.dataTables.min.js\"\n  ),\n  htmlDependency(\n    \"datatables-bootstrap\", \"1.10.2\",\n    c(file = system.file(\"www/datatables\", package = \"shinybootstrap2\")),\n    stylesheet = c(\"css/dataTables.bootstrap.css\", \"css/dataTables.extra.css\"),\n    script = \"js/dataTables.bootstrap.js\"\n  )\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nSo `dataTableDependency` was a list object defined in top-level package code and its value was constructed from paths obtained via `system.file()`.\nAs described in [a GitHub issue](https://github.com/rstudio/htmltools/issues/22),\n\n> This works fine when the package is built and tested on the same machine.\n> However, if the package is built on one machine and then used on another (as is the case with CRAN binary packages), then this will fail -- the dependency will point to the wrong directory on the host.\n\nThe heart of the solution is to make sure that `system.file()` is called from a function, at run time.\nIndeed, this fix was made here (in commit [138db47](https://github.com/rstudio/shinybootstrap2/commit/138db47e6bef195f14f6a14f4289ca445e9b2efa#diff-fedcc5cc99f3d44a4caf06f8e6e0ae08)) and in a few other packages that had similar code and a related check was added in `htmlDependency()` itself.\nThis particular problem would now be caught by `R CMD check`, due to changes that came with [staged installation](https://developer.r-project.org/Blog/public/2019/02/14/staged-install/index.html) as of R 3.6.0.\n\n### Example: Available colours\n\nThe crayon package has a function, `crayon::show_ansi_colors()`, that displays an ANSI colour table on your screen, basically to show what sort of styling is possible.\nIn an early version, the function looked something like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nshow_ansi_colors <- function(colors = num_colors()) {\n  if (colors < 8) {\n    cat(\"Colors are not supported\")\n  } else if (colors < 256) {\n    cat(ansi_colors_8, sep = \"\")\n    invisible(ansi_colors_8)\n  } else {\n    cat(ansi_colors_256, sep = \"\")\n    invisible(ansi_colors_256)\n  }\n}\n\nansi_colors_8 <- # code to generate a vector covering basic terminal colors\n  \nansi_colors_256 <- # code to generate a vector covering 256 colors\n```\n:::\n\n\nwhere `ansi_colors_8` and `ansi_colors_256` were character vectors exploring a certain set of colours, presumably styled via ANSI escapes.\n\nThe problem was those objects were formed and cached when the binary package was built.\nSince that often happens on a headless server, this likely happens under conditions where terminal colours might not be enabled or even available.\nUsers of the installed package could still call `show_ansi_colors()` and `num_colors()` would detect the number of colours supported by their system (256 on most modern computers).\nBut then an un-coloured object would print to screen (the original GitHub issue is [r-lib/crayon#37](https://github.com/r-lib/crayon/issues/37)).\n\nThe solution was to compute the display objects with a function at run time (in commit [e2b368a](https://github.com/r-lib/crayon/commit/e2b368ac27331d82154f85299f18efbc36227caa):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nshow_ansi_colors <- function(colors = num_colors()) {\n  if (colors < 8) {\n    cat(\"Colors are not supported\")\n  } else if (colors < 256) {\n    cat(ansi_colors_8(), sep = \"\")\n    invisible(ansi_colors_8())\n  } else {\n    cat(ansi_colors_256(), sep = \"\")\n    invisible(ansi_colors_256())\n  }\n}\n\nansi_colors_8 <- function() {\n  # code to generate a vector covering basic terminal colors\n}\n  \nansi_colors_256 <- function() {\n  # code to generate a vector covering 256 colors\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nLiterally, the same code is used, it is simply pushed down into the body of a function taking no arguments (similar to the shinybootstrap2 example).\nEach reference to, e.g., the `ansi_colors_8` object is replaced by a call to the `ansi_colors_8()` function.\n\nThe main takeaway is that functions that assess or expose the capabilities of your package on a user's system must fully execute on your user's system.\nIt's fairly easy to accidentally rely on results that were cached at build time, quite possibly on a different machine.\n\n### Example: Aliasing a function\n\nOne last example shows that, even if you are careful to only define functions below `R/`, there are still some subtleties to consider.\nImagine that you want the function `foo()` in your package to basically be an alias for the function `blah()` from some other package, e.g. pkgB.\nYou might be tempted to do this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfoo <- pkgB::blah\n```\n:::\n\n\nHowever, this will cause `foo()` in your package to reflect the definition of `pkgB::blah()` at the version present on the machine where the binary package is built (often CRAN), at that moment in time.\nIf a bug is discovered in `pkgB::blah()` and subsequently fixed, your package will still use the older, buggy version, until your package is rebuilt (often by CRAN) and your users upgrade, which is completely out of your control.\nThis alternative approach protects you from this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfoo <- function(...) pkgB::blah(...)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow, when your user calls `foo()`, they are effectively calling `pkgB::blah()`, at the version installed on *their* machine at that very moment.\n\nA real example of this affected an older version of knitr, related to how the default \"evaluate\" hook was being set to `evaluate::evaluate()` (original issue is [yihui/knitr#1441](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/issues/1441), resolved in commit [d6b53e0](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/commit/d6b53e0f15a8afd1de4987a86931ba54f886278d)).\n\n## Respect the R landscape {#sec-code-r-landscape}\n\nAnother big difference between a script and a package is that other people are going to use your package, and they're going to use it in situations that you never imagined.\nThis means you need to pay attention to the R landscape, which includes not just the available functions and objects, but all the global settings.\n\nYou have changed the R landscape if you've loaded a package with `library()`, or changed a global option with `options()`, or modified the working directory with `setwd()`.\nIf the behaviour of *other* functions differs before and after running your function, you've modified the landscape.\n@sec-package-within-side-effects has a concrete example of this involving time zones and the locale-specific printing of datetimes.\nChanging the landscape is bad because it makes code much harder to understand.\n\nThere are some functions that modify global settings that you should never use because there are better alternatives:\n\n-   **Don't use `library()` or `require()`**.\n    These modify the search path, affecting what functions are available from the global environment.\n    Instead, you should use the `DESCRIPTION` to specify your package's requirements, as described in @sec-description.\n    This also makes sure those packages are installed when your package is installed.\n\n-   **Never use `source()`** to load code from a file.\n    `source()` modifies the current environment, inserting the results of executing the code.\n    There is no reason to use `source()` inside your package, i.e. in a file below `R/`.\n    Sometimes people `source()` files below `R/` during package development, but as we've explained in @sec-workflow101-load-all and @sec-code-load-all, `load_all()` is a much better way to load your current code for exploration.\n    If you're using `source()` to create a dataset, it is better to use the methods in @sec-data for including data in a package.\n\nHere is a non-exhaustive list of other functions that should be used with caution:\n\n-   `options()`\n-   `par()`\n-   `setwd()`\n-   `Sys.setenv()`\n-   `Sys.setlocale()`\n-   `set.seed()` (or anything that changes the state of the random number generator)\n\n<!-- TODO: maybe tell one or more of the scary stories in <https://github.com/hadley/r-pkgs/issues/447> -->\n\nIf you must use them, make sure to clean up after yourself.\nBelow we show how to do this using functions from the withr package and in base R.\n\nThe flip side of this coin is that you should avoid relying on the user's landscape, which might be different to yours.\nFor example, functions that rely on sorting strings are dangerous, because sort order depends on the system locale.\nBelow we see that locales one might actually encounter in practice (C, English, French, etc.) differ in how they sort non-ASCII strings or uppercase versus lowercase letters.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- c(\"bernard\", \"bérénice\", \"béatrice\", \"boris\")\n\nwithr::with_locale(c(LC_COLLATE = \"fr_FR\"), sort(x))\n#> [1] \"béatrice\" \"bérénice\" \"bernard\"  \"boris\"\nwithr::with_locale(c(LC_COLLATE = \"C\"), sort(x))\n#> [1] \"bernard\"  \"boris\"    \"béatrice\" \"bérénice\"\n\nx <- c(\"a\", \"A\", \"B\", \"b\", \"A\", \"b\")\n\nwithr::with_locale(c(LC_COLLATE = \"en_CA\"), sort(x))\n#> [1] \"a\" \"A\" \"A\" \"b\" \"b\" \"B\"\nwithr::with_locale(c(LC_COLLATE = \"C\"), sort(x))\n#> [1] \"A\" \"A\" \"B\" \"a\" \"b\" \"b\"\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf you write your functions as if all users have the same system locale as you, your code might fail.\n\n### Manage state with withr\n\nIf you need to modify the R landscape inside a function, then it is important to ensure your change is reversed *on exit* of that function.\nThis is exactly what `base::on.exit()` is designed to do.\nYou use `on.exit()` inside a function to register code to run later, that restores the landscape to its original state.\nIt is important to note that proper tools, such as `on.exit()`, work even if we exit the function abnormally, i.e. due to an error.\nThis is why it's worth using the official methods described here over any do-it-yourself solution.\n\nWe usually manage state using the [withr package](https://withr.r-lib.org), which provides a flexible, `on.exit()`-like toolkit (`on.exit()` itself is covered in the next section).\n`withr::defer()` can be used as a drop-in replacement for `on.exit()`.\nWhy do we like withr so much?\nFirst, it offers many pre-built convenience functions for state changes that come up often.\nWe also appreciate withr's default stack-like behaviour (LIFO = last in, first out), its usability in interactive sessions, and its `envir` argument (in more advanced usage).\n\nThe general pattern is to capture the original state, schedule its eventual restoration \"on exit\", then make the state change.\nSome setters, such as `options()` or `par()`, return the old value when you provide a new value, leading to usage that looks like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nf <- function(x, y, z) {\n  ...                        # width option \"as found\"\n  old <- options(width = 20) # width option is 20\n  defer(options(old))        # width option is 20\n  ...                        # width option is 20\n}                            # original width option restored\n```\n:::\n\n\nCertain state changes, such as modifying session options, come up so often that withr offers pre-made helpers.\n@tbl-withr-greatest-hits shows a few of the state change helpers in withr that you are most likely to find useful:\n\n| Do / undo this              | withr functions                     |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Set an R option             | `with_options()`, `local_options()` |\n| Set an environment variable | `with_envvar()`, `local_envvar()`   |\n| Change working directory    | `with_dir()`, `local_dir()`         |\n| Set a graphics parameter    | `with_par()`, `local_par()`         |\n\n: Selected functions from withr. {#tbl-withr-greatest-hits}\n\nYou'll notice each helper comes in two forms that are useful in different situations:\n\n-   `with_*()` functions are best for executing small snippets of code with a temporarily modified state.\n    (These functions are inspired by how `base::with()` works.)\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    f <- function(x, sig_digits) {\n      # imagine lots of code here\n      withr::with_options(\n        list(digits = sig_digits),\n        print(x)\n      )\n      # ... and a lot more code here\n    }\n    ```\n    :::\n\n\n-   `local_*()` functions are best for modifying state \"from now until the function exits\".\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    g <- function(x, sig_digits) {\n      withr::local_options(list(digits = sig_digits))\n      print(x)\n      # imagine lots of code here\n    }\n    ```\n    :::\n\n\nDeveloping code interactively with withr is pleasant, because deferred actions can be scheduled even on the global environment.\nThose cleanup actions can then be executed with `withr::deferred_run()` or cleared without execution with `withr::deferred_clear()`.\nWithout this feature, it can be tricky to experiment with code that needs cleanup \"on exit\", because it behaves so differently when executed in the console versus at arm's length inside a function.\n\nMore in-depth coverage is given in the withr vignette [Changing and restoring state](https://withr.r-lib.org/articles/changing-and-restoring-state.html) and withr will also prove useful when we talk about testing in @sec-testing-basics.\n\n### Restore state with `base::on.exit()`\n\nHere is how the general \"save, schedule restoration, change\" pattern looks when using `base::on.exit()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nf <- function(x, y, z) {\n  ...\n  old <- options(mfrow = c(2, 2), pty = \"s\")\n  on.exit(options(old), add = TRUE)\n  ...\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nOther state changes aren't available with that sort of setter and you must implement it yourself.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ng <- function(a, b, c) {\n  ...\n  scratch_file <- tempfile()\n  on.exit(unlink(scratch_file), add = TRUE)\n  file.create(scratch_file)\n  ...\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nNote that we specify `on.exit(..., add = TRUE)`, because you almost always want this behaviour, i.e. to *add* to the list of deferred cleanup tasks rather than to *replace* them entirely.\nThis (and the default value of `after`) are related to our preference for `withr::defer()`, when we're willing to take a dependency on withr.\nThese issues are explored in a [withr vignette](https://withr.r-lib.org/articles/changing-and-restoring-state.html).\n\n### Isolate side effects\n\nCreating plots and printing output to the console are two other ways of affecting the global R environment.\nOften you can't avoid these (because they're important!) but it's good practice to isolate them in functions that **only** produce output.\nThis also makes it easier for other people to repurpose your work for new uses.\nFor example, if you separate data preparation and plotting into two functions, others can use your data prep work (which is often the hardest part!) to create new visualisations.\n\n### When you **do** need side-effects {#sec-code-onLoad-onAttach}\n\nOccasionally, packages do need side-effects.\nThis is most common if your package talks to an external system --- you might need to do some initial setup when the package loads.\nTo do that, you can use two special functions: `.onLoad()` and `.onAttach()`.\nThese are called when the package is loaded and attached.\nYou'll learn about the distinction between the two in @sec-dependencies-attach-vs-load.\nFor now, you should always use `.onLoad()` unless explicitly directed otherwise.\n\nSome common uses of `.onLoad()` and `.onAttach()` are:\n\n-   To set custom options for your package with `options()`.\n    To avoid conflicts with other packages, ensure that you prefix option names with the name of your package.\n    Also be careful not to override options that the user has already set.\n    Here's a (highly redacted) version of dplyr's `.onLoad()` function which sets an option that controls progress reporting:\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    .onLoad <- function(libname, pkgname) {\n      op <- options()\n      op.dplyr <- list(\n        dplyr.show_progress = TRUE\n      )\n      toset <- !(names(op.dplyr) %in% names(op))\n      if (any(toset)) options(op.dplyr[toset])\n      \n      invisible()\n    }\n    ```\n    :::\n\n\n    This allows functions in dplyr to use `getOption(\"dplyr.show_progress\")` to determine whether to show progress bars, relying on the fact that a sensible default value has already been set.\n\n<!-- TODO: I don't think the option setting example is so great anymore. I lean towards replacement. Other possible examples of `.onLoad()` usage: Register S3 methods. Detect capabilities of the system or of other packages. -->\n\n-   To display an informative message when the package is attached.\n    This might make usage conditions clear or display package capabilities based on current system conditions.\n    Startup messages are one place where you should use `.onAttach()` instead of `.onLoad()`.\n    To display startup messages, always use `packageStartupMessage()`, and not `message()`.\n    (This allows `suppressPackageStartupMessages()` to selectively suppress package startup messages).\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    .onAttach <- function(libname, pkgname) {\n      packageStartupMessage(\"Welcome to my package\")\n    }\n    ```\n    :::\n\n\nAs you can see in the examples, `.onLoad()` and `.onAttach()` are called with two arguments: `libname` and `pkgname`.\nThey're rarely used (they're a holdover from the days when you needed to use `library.dynam()` to load compiled code).\nThey give the path where the package is installed (the \"library\"), and the name of the package.\n\nIf you use `.onLoad()`, consider using `.onUnload()` to clean up any side effects.\nBy convention, `.onLoad()` and friends are usually saved in a file called `R/zzz.R`.\n(Note that `.First.lib()` and `.Last.lib()` are old versions of `.onLoad()` and `.onUnload()` and should no longer be used.)\n\nOne especially hairy thing to do in a function like `.onLoad()` or `.onAttach()` is to change the state of the random number generator.\nOnce upon a time, ggplot2 used `sample()` when deciding whether to show a startup message, but only in interactive sessions.\nThis, in turn, created a reproducibility puzzle for users who were using `set.seed()` for their own purposes, prior to attaching ggplot2 with `library(ggplot2)`, and running the code both interactively and noninteractively.\nThe chosen solution was to wrap the offending startup code inside `withr::with_preserve_seed()`, which leaves the user's random seed as it found it.\n\n## Constant health checks\n\nHere is a typical sequence of calls when using devtools for package development:\n\n1.  Edit one or more files below `R/`.\n2.  `document()` (if you've made any changes that impact help files or NAMESPACE)\n3.  `load_all()`\n4.  Run some examples interactively.\n5.  `test()` (or `test_active_file()`)\n6.  `check()`\n\nAn interesting question is how frequently and rapidly you move through this development cycle.\nWe often find ourselves running through the above sequence several times in an hour or in a day while adding or modifying a single function.\n\nThose newer to package development might be most comfortable slinging R code and much less comfortable writing and compiling documentation, simulating package build & installation, testing, and running `R CMD check`.\nAnd it is human nature to embrace the familiar and postpone the unfamiliar.\nThis often leads to a dysfunctional workflow where the full sequence above unfolds infrequently, maybe once per month or every couple of months, very slowly and often with great pain:\n\n1.  Edit one or more files below `R/`.\n2.  Build, install, and use the package. Iterate occasionally with previous step.\n3.  Write documentation (once the code is \"done\").\n4.  Write tests (once the code is \"done\").\n5.  Run `R CMD check` right before submitting to CRAN or releasing in some other way.\n\nWe've already talked about the value of fast feedback, in the context of `load_all()`.\nBut this also applies to running `document()`, `test()`, and `check()`.\nThere are defects you just can't detect from using `load_all()` and running a few interactive examples that are immediately revealed by more formal checks.\nFinding and fixing 5 bugs, one at a time, right after you created each one is much easier than troubleshooting all 5 at once (possibly interacting with each other), weeks or months after you last touched the code.\n\n::: callout-warning\n## Submitting to CRAN\n\nIf you're planning on submitting your package to CRAN, you must use only ASCII characters in your `.R` files.\nIn practice, this means you are limited to the digits 0 to 9, lowercase letters 'a' to 'z', uppercase letters 'A' to 'Z', and common punctuation.\n\nBut sometimes you need to inline a small bit of character data that includes, e.g., a Greek letter (µ), an accented character (ü), or a symbol (30°).\nYou can use any Unicode character as long as you specify it in the special Unicode escape `\"\\u1234\"` format.\nThe easiest way to find the correct code point is to use `stringi::stri_escape_unicode()`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- \"This is a bullet •\"\ny <- \"This is a bullet \\u2022\"\nidentical(x, y)\n#> [1] TRUE\ncat(stringi::stri_escape_unicode(x))\n#> This is a bullet \\u2022\n```\n:::\n\n\nSometimes you have the opposite problem.\nYou don't *intentionally* have any non-ASCII characters in your R code, but automated checks reveal that you do.\n\n```         \nW  checking R files for non-ASCII characters ...\n   Found the following file with non-ASCII characters:\n     foo.R\n   Portable packages must use only ASCII characters in their R code,\n   except perhaps in comments.\n   Use \\uxxxx escapes for other characters.\n```\n\nThe most common offenders are \"curly\" or \"smart\" single and double quotes that sneak in through copy/paste.\nThe functions `tools::showNonASCII()` and `tools::showNonASCIIfile(file)` help you find the offending file(s) and line(s).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntools::showNonASCIIfile(\"R/foo.R\")\n#> 666: #' If you<e2><80><99>ve copy/pasted quotes, watch out!\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n",
