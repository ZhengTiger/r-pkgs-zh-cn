    "markdown": "# The Whole Game {#sec-whole-game}\n\n\n\n\n\n*Spoiler alert!*\n\nThis chapter runs through the development of a small toy package.\nIt's meant to paint the Big Picture and suggest a workflow, before we descend into the detailed treatment of the key components of an R package.\n\nTo keep the pace brisk, we exploit the modern conveniences in the devtools package and the RStudio IDE. In later chapters, we are more explicit about what those helpers are doing for us.\n\nThis chapter is self-contained, in that completing the exercise is not a strict requirement to continue with the rest of the book, however we strongly suggest you follow along and create this toy package with us.\n\n## Load devtools and friends\n\nYou can initiate your new package from any active R session.\nYou don't need to worry about whether you're in an existing or new project or not.\nThe functions we use ensure that we create a new clean project for the package.\n\nLoad the devtools package, which is the public face of a set of packages that support various aspects of package development.\nThe most obvious of these is the usethis package, which you'll see is also being loaded.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='whole-game_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-2_f437eb0d0ea98ad340105401ae4161fa'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(devtools)\n#> Warning: package 'devtools' was built under R version 4.2.3\n#> Loading required package: usethis\n#> Warning: package 'usethis' was built under R version 4.2.3\n```\n:::\n\n\nDo you have an old version of devtools?\nCompare your version against ours and upgrade if necessary.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='whole-game_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-3_995d8137b87d907b1183991712bcc74d'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npackageVersion(\"devtools\")\n#> [1] '2.4.5'\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Toy package: regexcite\n\nTo help walk you through the process, we use various functions from devtools to build a small toy package from scratch, with features commonly seen in released packages:\n\n-   Functions to address a specific need, in this case helpers for work with regular expressions.\n-   Version control and an open development process.\n    -   This is completely optional in your work, but highly recommended. You'll see how Git and GitHub help us expose all the intermediate stages of our toy package.\n-   Access to established workflows for installation, getting help, and checking quality.\n    -   Documentation for individual functions via [roxygen2](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org).\n    -   Unit testing with [testthat](https://testthat.r-lib.org).\n    -   Documentation for the package as a whole via an executable `README.Rmd`.\n\nWe call the package **regexcite** and it contains a couple of functions that make common tasks with regular expressions easier.\nPlease note that these functions are very simple and we're only using them here as a means to guide you through the package development process.\nIf you're looking for actual helpers for work with regular expressions, there are several proper R packages that address this problem space:\n\n-   [stringr](https://stringr.tidyverse.org) (which uses stringi)\n-   [stringi](https://stringi.gagolewski.com/)\n-   [rex](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rex)\n-   [rematch2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rematch2)\n\nAgain, the regexcite package itself is just a device for demonstrating a typical workflow for package development with devtools.\n\n## Preview the finished product\n\nThe regexcite package is tracked during its development with the Git version control system.\nThis is purely optional and you can certainly follow along without implementing this.\nA nice side benefit is that we eventually connect it to a remote repository on GitHub, which means you can see the glorious result we are working towards by visiting regexcite on GitHub: <https://github.com/jennybc/regexcite>.\nBy inspecting the [commit history](https://github.com/jennybc/regexcite/commits/main) and especially the diffs, you can see exactly what changes at each step of the process laid out below.\n\n<!-- TODO: I think these diffs are extremely useful and would like to surface them better here. -->\n\n## `create_package()`\n\nCall `create_package()` to initialize a new package in a directory on your computer.\n`create_package()` will automatically create that directory if it doesn't exist yet (and that is usually the case).\nSee @sec-workflow101-create-package for more on creating packages.\n\nMake a deliberate choice about where to create this package on your computer.\nIt should probably be somewhere within your home directory, alongside your other R projects.\nIt should not be nested inside another RStudio Project, R package, or Git repo.\nNor should it be in an R package library, which holds packages that have already been built and installed.\nThe conversion of the source package we create here into an installed package is part of what devtools facilitates.\nDon't try to do devtools' job for it!\n\nOnce you've selected where to create this package, substitute your chosen path into a `create_package()` call like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='whole-game_cache/html/create-package-fake_6bca6bdf73659d3258298c1ab0ed8717'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncreate_package(\"~/path/to/regexcite\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nFor the creation of this book we have to work in a temporary directory, because the book is built non-interactively in the cloud.\nBehind the scenes, we're executing our own `create_package()` command, but don't be surprised if our output differs a bit from yours.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='whole-game_cache/html/create-package_1c3d226d29c9ea08978f171b17aa2ab6'}\n\n```\n#> ✔ Creating

RStudio, opened into your new regexcite package (and Project).\nIf you somehow need to do this manually, navigate to the directory and double click on `regexcite.Rproj`.\nRStudio has special handling for packages and you should now see a *Build* tab in the same pane as *Environment* and *History*.\n\nYou probably need to call `library(devtools)` again, because `create_package()` has probably dropped you into a fresh R session, in your new package.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='whole-game_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-4_f937966e79307cb2aa258c3f399f5a3b'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(devtools)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhat's in this new directory that is also an R package and, probably, an RStudio Project?\nHere's a listing (locally, you can consult your *Files* pane):\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='whole-game_cache/html/init-show-files_a47fd69453a250c9e56d0deb0269a270'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|path            |type

[\"dotfiles\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_file_and_hidden_directory#Unix_and_Unix-like_environments)).\nA select few are visible all the time, but sometimes you want to see them all.\n:::\n\n-   `.Rbuildignore` lists files that we need to have around but that should not be included when building the R package from source. If you aren't using RStudio, `create_package()` may not create this file (nor `.gitignore`) at first, since there's no RStudio-related machinery that needs to be ignored. However, you will likely develop the need for `.Rbuildignore` at some point, regardless of what editor you are using. It is discussed in more detail in @sec-rbuildignore.\n-   `.Rproj.user`, if you have it, is a directory used internally by RStudio.\n-   `.gitignore` anticipates Git usage and tells Git to ignore some standard, behind-the-scenes files created by R and RStudio. Even if you do not plan to use Git, this is harmless.\n-   `DESCRIPTION` provides metadata about your package. We edit this shortly and @sec-description covers the general topic of the `DESCRIPTION` file.\n-   `NAMESPACE` declares the functions your package exports for external use and the external functions your package imports from other packages. At this point, it is empty, except for a comment declaring that this is a file you should not edit by hand.\n-   The `R/` directory is the \"business end\" of your package. It will soon contain `.R` files with function definitions.\n-   `regexcite.Rproj` is the file that makes this directory an RStudio Project. Even if you don't use RStudio, this file is harmless. Or you can suppress its creation with `create_package(..., rstudio = FALSE)`. More in @sec-workflow101-rstudio-projects.\n\n## `use_git()`\n\nThe regexcite directory is an R source package and an RStudio Project.\nNow we make it also a Git repository, with `use_git()`.\n(By the way, `use_git()` works in any project, regardless of whether it's an R package.)\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='whole-game_cache/html/use-git_1b19302059fe6870ea7f09def24f0c70'}\n\n```{.r

if you want to commit some files here and you should accept the offer.\nBehind the scenes, we'll also commit those same files.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what has changed in the package?\nOnly the creation of a `.git` directory, which is hidden in most contexts, including the RStudio file browser.\nIts existence is evidence that we have indeed initialized a Git repo here.\n\n\n::: {.cell

Git* and *initialize a new git repository for this project*.\n:::\n\n## Write the first function\n\nA fairly common task when dealing with strings is the need to split a single string into many parts.\nThe `strsplit()` function in base R does exactly this.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='whole-game_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-5_e71f220807d1fe79b6f4ae2cfed0f7f3'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n(x <- \"alfa,bravo,charlie,delta\")\n#> [1] \"alfa,bravo,charlie,delta\"\nstrsplit(x, split = \",\")\n#> [[1]]\n#> [1] \"alfa\"    \"bravo\"   \"charlie\" \"delta\"\n```\n:::\n\n\nTake a close look at the return value.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='whole-game_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-6_f3106bd0ab3b8892e18e84771ffd67f3'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstr(strsplit(x, split = \",\"))\n#> List of 1\n#>  $ : chr [1:4] \"alfa\" \"bravo\" \"charlie\" \"delta\"\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe shape of this return value often surprises people or, at least, inconveniences them.\nThe input is a character vector of length one and the output is a list of length one.\nThis makes total sense in light of R's fundamental tendency towards vectorization.\nBut sometimes it's still a bit of a bummer.\nOften you know that your input is morally a scalar, i.e. it's just a single string, and really want the output to be the character vector of its parts.\n\nThis leads R users to employ various methods of \"unlist\"-ing the result:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='whole-game_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-7_5c26d4ce4144e5550b8a7af9e8b13054'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nunlist(strsplit(x, split = \",\"))\n#> [1] \"alfa\"    \"bravo\"   \"charlie\" \"delta\"\n\nstrsplit(x, split = \",\")[[1]]\n#> [1] \"alfa\"    \"bravo\"   \"charlie\" \"delta\"\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe second, safer solution is the basis for the inaugural function of regexcite: `strsplit1()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell engine.opts='{\"file\":\"R/strsplit1.R\"}' hash='whole-game_cache/html/strsplit1-write_c64dddb598e2ff643f4a3949919478e0'}\n\n```{.cat .r .cell-code}\nstrsplit1 <- function(x, split) {\n  strsplit(x, split = split)[[1]]\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis book does not teach you how to write functions in R.\nTo learn more about that take a look at the [Functions chapter](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/functions.html) of R for Data Science and the [Functions chapter](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/functions.html) of Advanced R.\n\n::: callout-tip\nThe name of `strsplit1()` is a nod to the very handy `paste0()`, which first appeared in R 2.15.0 in 2012.\n`paste0()` was created to address the extremely common use case of `paste()`-ing strings together *without* a separator.\n`paste0()` has been lovingly described as [\"statistical computing's most influential contribution of the 21st century\"](https://simplystatistics.org/posts/2013-01-31-paste0-is-statistical-computings-most-influential-contribution-of-the-21st-century/).\n\nThe `strsplit1()` function was so inspiring that it's now a real function in the stringr package: `stringr::str_split_1()`!\n:::\n\n## `use_r()`\n\nWhere should you put the definition of `strsplit1()`?\nSave it in a `.R` file, in the `R/` subdirectory of your package.\nA reasonable starting position is to make a new `.R` file for each user-facing function in your package and name the file after the function.\nAs you add more functions, you'll want to relax this and begin to group related functions together.\nWe'll save the definition of `strsplit1()` in the file `R/strsplit1.R`.\n\nThe helper `use_r()` creates and/or opens a script below `R/`.\nIt really shines in a more mature package, when navigating between `.R` files and the associated test file.\nBut, even here, it's useful to keep yourself from getting too carried away while working in `Untitled4`.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='whole-game_cache/html/init-strsplit1_61ea12ebf54a5f702609963ca2fca6e8'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nuse_r(\"strsplit1\")\n#> • Edit 'R/strsplit1.R'\n```\n:::\n\n\nPut the definition of `strsplit1()` **and only the definition of `strsplit1()`** in `R/strsplit1.R` and save it.\nThe file `R/strsplit1.R` should NOT contain any of the other top-level code we have recently executed, such as the definition of our practice input `x`, `library(devtools)`, or `use_git()`.\nThis foreshadows an adjustment you'll need to make as you transition from writing R scripts to R packages.\nPackages and scripts use different mechanisms to declare their dependency on other packages and to store example or test code.\nWe explore this further in @sec-r.\n\n## `load_all()` {#sec-whole-game-load-all}\n\nHow do we test drive `strsplit1()`?\nIf this were a regular R script, we might use RStudio to send the function definition to the R Console and define `strsplit1()` in the global environment.\nOr maybe we'd call `source(\"R/strsplit1.R\")`.\nFor package development, however, devtools offers a more robust approach.\n\nCall `load_all()` to make `strsplit1()` available for experimentation.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='whole-game_cache/html/load-all_aea6d4a149328c403b503d48a73e9d1e'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nload_all()\n#> ℹ Loading regexcite\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow call `strsplit1(x)` to see how it works.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='whole-game_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-8_1919cdeceaa9d9c09a9fd2362c7d7fe6'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n(x <- \"alfa,bravo,charlie,delta\")\n#> [1] \"alfa,bravo,charlie,delta\"\nstrsplit1(x, split = \",\")\n#> [1] \"alfa\"    \"bravo\"   \"charlie\" \"delta\"\n```\n:::\n\n\nNote that `load_all()` has made the `strsplit1()` function available, although it does not exist in the global environment.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='whole-game_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-9_d65bee05b9698ae5961c029a4ba28a96'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nexists(\"strsplit1\", where = globalenv(), inherits = FALSE)\n#> [1] FALSE\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf you see `TRUE` instead of `FALSE`, that indicates you're still using a script-oriented workflow and sourcing your functions.\nHere's how to get back on track:\n\n-   Clean out the global environment and restart R.\n-   Re-attach devtools with `library(devtools)` and re-load regexcite with `load_all()`.\n-   Redefine the test input `x` and call `strsplit1(x, split = \",\")` again.

(Re)generates `NAMESPACE`.\n\nThe second job is especially important here, since we will no longer export `strsplit1()` and we will newly export `str_split_one()`.\nDon't be dismayed by the warning about `\"Objects listed as exports, but not present in namespace: strsplit1\"`.\nThat always happens when you remove something from the namespace.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='whole-game_cache/html/document-str-split-one_70fa23c194f81d4d52b03c0809e7fbac'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndocument()\n#> ℹ Updating regexcite documentation\n#> ℹ Loading regexcite\n#> Warning: Objects listed as exports, but not present in namespace:\n#> • strsplit1\n#> Writing 'NAMESPACE'\n#> Writing 'str_split_one.Rd'\n#> Deleting 'strsplit1.Rd'\n```\n:::\n\n\nTry out the new `str_split_one()` function by simulating package installation via `load_all()`:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='whole-game_cache/html/str-split-one-test-drive_b6b6261985c349ec68eb0ff97002fd87'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nload_all()\n#> ℹ Loading regexcite\nstr_split_one(\"a, b, c\", pattern = \", \")\n#> [1] \"a\" \"b\" \"c\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## `use_github()`\n\nYou've seen us making commits during the development process for regexcite.\nYou can see an indicative history at <https://github.com/jennybc/regexcite>.\nOur use of version control and the decision to expose the development process means you can inspect the state of the regexcite source at each developmental stage.\nBy looking at so-called diffs, you can see exactly how each devtools helper function modifies the source files that constitute the regexcite package.\n\nHow would you connect your local regexcite package and Git repository to a companion repository on GitHub?\nHere are three approaches:\n\n1.  [`use_github()`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/use_github.html) is a helper that we recommend for the long-term. We won't demonstrate it here because it requires some credential setup on your end. We also don't want to tear down and rebuild the public regexcite package every time we build this book.\n2.  Set up the GitHub repo first! It sounds counter-intuitive, but the easiest way to get your work onto GitHub is to initiate there, then use RStudio to start working in a synced local copy. This approach is described in Happy Git's workflows [New project, GitHub first](https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html) and [Existing project, GitHub first](https://happygitwithr.com/existing-github-first.html).\n3.  Command line Git can always be used to add a remote repository *post hoc*. This is described in the Happy Git workflow [Existing project, GitHub last](https://happygitwithr.com/existing-github-last.html).\n\nAny of these approaches will connect your local regexcite project to a GitHub repo, public or private, which you can push to or pull from using the Git client built into RStudio.\nIn @sec-sw-dev-practices, we elaborate on why version control (e.g., Git) and, specifically, hosted version control (e.g. GitHub) is worth incorporating into your package development process.\n\n## `use_readme_rmd()`\n\nNow that your package is on GitHub, the `README.md` file matters.\nIt is the package's home page and welcome mat, at least until you decide to give it a website (see @sec-website), add a vignette (see @sec-vignettes), or submit it to CRAN (see @sec-release).\n\nThe `use_readme_rmd()` function initializes a basic, executable `README.Rmd` ready for you to edit:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='whole-game_cache/html/use-readme-rmd_ffa8d27aefa46645c0145c57309c2d4c'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nuse_readme_rmd()\n#> ✔ Writing 'README.Rmd'\n#> ✔ Adding '^README\\\\.Rmd$' to '.Rbuildignore'\n#> • Update 'README.Rmd' to include installation instructions.\n#> ✔ Writing '.git/hooks/pre-commit'\n```\n:::\n\n\nIn addition to creating `README.Rmd`, this adds some lines to `.Rbuildignore`, and creates a Git pre-commit hook to help you keep `README.Rmd` and `README.md` in sync.\n\n`README.Rmd` already has sections that prompt you to:\n\n-   Describe the purpose of the package.\n-   Provide installation instructions. If a GitHub remote is detected when `use_readme_rmd()` is called, this section is pre-filled with instructions on how to install from GitHub.\n-   Show a bit of usage.\n\nHow to populate this skeleton?\nCopy stuff liberally from `DESCRIPTION` and any formal and informal tests or examples you have.\nAnything is better than nothing.\nThis is helpful because people probably won't install your package and comb through individual help files to figure out how to use it.\n\nWe like to write the `README` in R Markdown, so it can feature actual usage.\nThe inclusion of live code also makes it less likely that your `README` grows stale and out-of-sync with your actual package.\n\nTo make your own edits, if RStudio has not already done so, open `README.Rmd` for editing.\nMake sure it shows some usage of `str_split_one()`.\n\nThe `README.Rmd` we use is here: [README.Rmd](https://github.com/jennybc/regexcite/blob/main/README.Rmd) and here's what it contains:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='whole-game_cache/html/reveal-README_b2f3b2929ea6b46c13a8cfa304231037'}\n\n````\n---\noutput: github_document\n---\n\n<!-- README.md is generated from README.Rmd.
